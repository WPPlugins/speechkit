AI Audio Platform for News Publishers

SpeechKit produces AI-read audio from your written posts in seconds. It gives your audience a more convenient and mobile medium to consume your posts — as podcasts.

Readers will be able to listen to written posts via the SpeechKit audio player embedded at the top of a post.

The SpeechKit plugin can be added to your site in minutes without the need to modify your existing infrastructure. See our medium post: [How to add audio to your WordPress posts with SpeechKit](https://medium.com/@SpeechKit/how-to-add-audio-to-your-wordpress-posts-with-speechkit-26b1982ebd26)
